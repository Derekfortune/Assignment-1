I played a lot of video games when I was younger which was my initial spark of interest in IT, taking computers apart to see how they worked to changing components within my PC to make it run better, these events ultimately highlighted the career path I would like to pursue, A Software Developer.</p>

<h2>When did your interest in IT start?</h2>
    <p>My interest in IT started roughly when I was 16 years old, playing video games with friends, thinking about how I’m able to communicate with my friends online via voice chats, and how realistic the video games we were playing where becoming. One conversation sparked the most of my interest which was in the form of an application for musicians.</p>
<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
    <p>My goal is to become a Software Developer, RMIT provides one of the best IT courses in Australia, plus the ability to participate in distance learning was a great advantage as I live in rural QLD.</p>

<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
    <p>I do not have many expectations I mainly hope that I will have the skills required to pursue a career in Software Development and have the ability to become a competent Software Developer.</p>


<h1>Project idea</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>The project I wish to outline is that in the form of a Mobile Phone app or Website based product, that focuses on musicians. Currently aspiring musicians must operate via an agent before being able to contact or be booked for any performances, the agent must contact the venue to book a musician of their choice. I intend to close the gap and develop an app that allows customers to view musicians content and book the musician via the app thus cutting the need for an agent, making the booking of a musician a more personal, simple and streamlined process.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>
    <p>The motivation behind this project begins with a close friend that operates as a musician he stated that 'I wish it was easier for venues to book musicians and they were able to view musicians content online giving the customer a taster of the music they will have at their venue prior to booking' after further conversation, he outlined that no other company offers customers the ability to skip out the agent that works for musicians to book them for a venue. I believed this could be streamlined into a more practical app or website that covered all problematic areas of booking a musician.</p>
<h2>Features of the application</h2>
    <p>The application, will allow users to access musicians videos/audio uploads of their content, allowing the user to hear a musicians music prior to booking them for the venue or function required, this allows the user to select a musician that fits the theme of the function being held at the venue. Each musician will be categorized by the genre of their music, as well as having filter options for highest to lowest price and the location of the musician. After selecting the desired musician, a calendar page will load, showing the musicians sessions available for booking. Once the musician is selected and the time slot booked in a payments page will load, this will outline the cost of the booking and will offer several payment methods making it easier for customers to pay with their most preferred method.
            Within the application there will be a search by location feature allowing users to type in a suburb, city or postcode, this feature will filter musicians within the local area of the customer via radius (in kms) the app will have a distance setting ranging from 5km’s to 100km’s which will display the profiles of musicians fitting the desired genre that will be selected prior to the radius function to further narrow the search results within the selected radius of the search.
            The application will allow musicians to display or link their social media accounts as well as link their Sound Cloud, YouTube and Spotify profiles, automatically displaying any content shared on these platforms if the musician allows access to the general public thus making the content visible globally, this will ultimately allow users to view the content of their desired musician prior to proceeding to checkout and fix the overall problem of not being able to view a bands content without accessing a musicians agent first. 
            There will be a chat section that will add a Social Media aspect to the application that allows users to add each other, share their experience with the selected musician they had play at their venue and find new friends online within the application.
            The application will also contain a feedback form area, where customers can leave feedback and rate the musician they had play at their function or venue, this will be a public feature that all users of the application can see, this gives the aspiring musicians valuable feedback on their performance that will allow them to expand their knowledge and improve their music.
            Lastly the application will allow musicians to share content with each other on a notification page similar to that of Facebook, this page will only be visible to likeminded musicians or verified musician accounts within the app, allowing musicians to interact with other musicians for feedback on their content as well as allowing musicians to have a general conversation with other </p>
<h2>Skills required</h2>
        <p>To successfully build the application/website outlined previously, a back-end Software Developer proficient in web development and application development will be required, as well as a front-end JavaScript developer to add styling to the application and website. Workers must have knowledge within an application with similar functions to the desired musician application to allow the project to flow and be built without delay. With how technology is advancing I believe it will be quite easy to find developers with the capabilities of making this application without much of a struggle.</p>


<h2>Outcome</h2>
        <p>Upon completion of the application being developed, the music industry will have a more streamlined and user-friendly way of displaying their content globally and allow customers to view their content (music) prior to booking them for their function. The overall goal is to eliminate the need for an agent who acts on behalf of musicians to find them functions to play at. By allowing customers to access a calendar outlining the musicians availability, this immediately eliminates the need for an agent that operates for musicians.</p>
